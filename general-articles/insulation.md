# Insulation

### R-value

* sauce: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_(insulation)
* In general: the higher the R-value, the better the insulating quality (which helps in both summer and winter)
* R-value of brick is crap: 0.44. Search for R4 (economical option) or R6 insulation for Aus.
* R-value is not that easy a concept to understand, because it has two variables (which can change according to season): temperature diff between the colder a$

### Ceiling vs. Wall Insulation (Batts)

From reddit:
>Spend your money on installing Sarking/Foil insulation. Its a layer that goes directly underneath the tiles or the colorbond. It will help you the most in summer. It will be difficult to install. The difference in summer will be dramatic. Installing thicker batts will mostly improve things in winter but not much in summer. Sarking will stop heat getting to the batts / blow-in. Thicker batts could make things worse in summer. Reason:
>
> * Bulk Insulation (batts/blow in) delay heat from transferring from one side to another (Upwards or Downwards).
> * In summer, it will be inevitable for the heat in the roof to eventually get through the R4.0 batts and warm up your ceiling in the living areas. (Just touch the ceiling on a warm day to feel it).
> * At night, when you want the heat to escape, you'll find that the batts keep the heat in your house.
> * The solution is to install a reflective barrier.
