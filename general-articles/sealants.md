# Sealants/Adhesives

>Silicone, caulk, mortar

* All these are different things which serve different purposes. Not much organization to this article yet other than a giant mass of dot points. 
* Caulk is a sealant, mortar is an adhesive. You cannot "stick" two bricks together horizontally (along their vertical faces) with caulk, but you can seal it. 
* Silicone degrades under sunlight within 5 - 10 years. Much less ideal for roof work; see polyurethane sealant instead. 
* Silicone is king in wet areas that don't need paint (e.g. bath). Aquariums use 100% silicone. Use this to seal gaps and cracks in wet areas. Common (circa 2021): GE silicone 2. Paintability is an aesthetic consideration, but usually compromises on function in some way. 
* Silicone is almost more elastic than caulk, allowing more movement. 
* **Siliconized latex caulk** for doors/windows/light external work. 
* There are mold-resistant silicone and caulk formulas (at least, 100% silicone is supposed to be mold-resistant), but all the mold resistance in the world won't matter if the sealant peels away from the tile at the edges and gets mold in the cracks. 
* >(De-molding silicone) Pretty sure we've got silicone around our bath but it still grows black and orange stuff. Every now and then I just roll some toilet paper lengths into sausages, pour some bleach on the silicone (bleach in a bottle designed for the toilet is easiest) and press the toilet paper sausage into it to keep it there overnight. Perfectly clean sealant the next day, just rinse away the bleach and flush the toilet paper.
