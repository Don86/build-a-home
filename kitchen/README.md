# How to Kitchen

* See MMM's article:https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2023/02/26/how-to-build-a-kitchen/
* MotS: renovating a kitchen is research-intensive but fun. You can DIY almost all of it except plumbing and electrical, even by your very generous standards of "everything is DIY if you're confident enough".
* cabinets suck, racks are good - storing sauces/bottles/jars in cabinets means that food gets hidden in the back/lost under piles of stuff. Racks are only 1 jar/bottle deep, 
making everything visually accessible for search at the cost of a very large amount of 2D space required. Cabinets are also a PITA to evacuate and clean out.
