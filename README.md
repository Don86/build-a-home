# General Concepts

### R-value

* sauce: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_(insulation)
* In general: the higher the R-value, the better the insulating quality (which helps in both summer and winter)
* R-value of brick is crap: 0.44. Search for R4 (economical option) or R6 insulation for Aus. 
* R-value is not that easy a concept to understand, because it has two variables (which can change according to season): temperature diff between the colder and hotter side of the barrier, and heat flux.
