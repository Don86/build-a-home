# Bath

* Pray that the waterproofer's done a good job, or you'll essentially have to tear down and rebuild the whole thing

### Shower

* Shower curtains win hands down for ease-of-maintenance, shower doors are better for keeping water within the shower-space. You can just unhook and toss shower curtains into the wash. Shower doors, and the shower door *frame*, are a seroius PITA to clean (weekly/fortnightly). 
* You can DIY some weights at the bottom of shower curtains to stop them from attacking you with their slimy hugs.
* You can stick your hand out of a shower curtain to grab a towel
* You can't use a high-pressure shower head with shower curtains, because the ricochet will cause curtains to blow out, unless the showerhead points directly downward. You'll have to use rain showers. 
* There are certain "tropical resort" aesthetics you can make use of for shower curtains.
* good alternative that looks expensive: shower screens. Note the extremely high hob: https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/rolling-shower-screen
* Tubs will, unfortunately, likely be just a waste of space. You won't use it personally (too much faff), you have no kids or pets to wash.

### Bathroom tiles

* Small tiles pros: rarely crack, chip or break. the texture makes for good slip resistance, and you can do neat patterns or even pictures with them. Grout comes in all colors. if a small tile gets broken, spares are easily kept without taking up a ton of room, and quickly installed.
* Small tile cons: it's nothing but monotony to install, and very easy to lose your straight lines if you dont use spacers. lots of grout means a hella messy install as well, and grout can be tricky to clean properly later. Anti-slip rubber mats are a thing now. 
* Big tile Pros: Easier to clean. Faster to install, though huge tiles pose their own difficulties. Less grout involved, so it's a bit cleaner to install as well. You can get specialty tiles with art on them if you so desire. A chipped or minor break in a tile is not necessarily critical, as edge tiles usually need to be cut and sized anyway, allowing for the removal of a broken area/edge and one less wasted tile.
* Big tile cons: Floors and walls tend to flex and give somewhat, so the bigger the tile the more likely it is to break and crack after installation. less grout and more tile area means the surface will be slick. Large tiles are more difficult to transport as they need larger boxes and are *very* heavy per stack, which increases the likelihood of damage during transport. When used on walls, a TON of adhesive needs to be used to ensure the wall flexing doesnt loosen them, causing them to fall. (you should be using lots anyway, but i'd be paranoid) If a large tile breaks, spares take up more room to keep and potentially take a little more time to install.
* Use large-ish bathroom tiles, unless you love scrubbing tile grout. Note: this may be more expensive per sqm.
* Grout sealant is also a thing: https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/diy-skills/tiling/how-to-seal-grout
* **Tiles are water proof, grout less so**. Grout is porous, and can wick water to places where you don't want them to go, or simply store them and grow mold. Note: scrubbing tile grout can scrub away grout sealant, so re-application is probably necessary.
